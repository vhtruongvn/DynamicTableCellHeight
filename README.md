=============

# Intro
This project demonstrates who to implement:
1. A dynamic cell height table view with storyboard and autolayout
2. A basic asynchronous image downloader (loads the images lazily)
3. Use GCD and Non-ARC
# Future Enhancements
* Performances! If your table view has a lot of cells, this can be very expensive and result in poor initial loading, reloading or scrolling performance.
