# Intro
### This project demonstrates:
###### A dynamic cell height table view with storyboard and autolayout
###### A basic asynchronous image downloader (loads the images lazily)
###### Use GCD and Non-ARC

# Future Enhancements
###### If the table view has a lot of cells, this can be very expensive and result in poor initial loading, reloading or scrolling performance.
